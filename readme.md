🎯 1. Perfect PSD Compatibility (or a Modern Equivalent Standard)
This is huge.
Even apps with better painting engines fail in studios because they can’t reliably open or export layered PSDs.
You need:
100% accurate layer structure
masks, blend modes, groups
alpha channels
color profiles
text layers staying editable
smart object equivalents (if possible)
If you can’t ensure compatibility with the dominant workflow format, pros can’t adopt it.
🎨 2. A Powerful, Fast, Customizable Brush Engine
Artists compare everything to:
Photoshop’s mixer + classic round brushes
CSP’s line control + stabilization
Krita’s massive customization
Procreate’s smooth performance at huge DPI
To compete:
zero-lag strokes
stabilization
texture support
dual/multi-input brushes (e.g., pressure + tilt + rotation)
modular brush system (nodes, modules, or layers inside brush settings)
realistic blending
This is one of the biggest differentiators in artist apps.
⚡ 3. Real Performance on Large Canvases
Professionals often work at:
600–1200 DPI
huge dimensions
dozens or hundreds of layers
Most apps choke.
Procreate is fast because of its efficient rendering engine. Photoshop uses tiling + GPU acceleration.
You need:
efficient tile-based canvas engine
GPU-accelerated painting
layer-based caching
smart memory handling
minimal latency
A painting app that never stutters is instantly attractive.
🧩 4. A Plugin/Extension Ecosystem
Photoshop is the standard partly because others can build on it.
If you provide:
a clean API
brush packs
asset packs
plugin store
scripting support (JS or Lua)
…your app becomes a platform.
This is a massive differentiator.
Artists love apps they can extend.
🌈 5. Professional Color Management
This is where most “aesthetic minimal apps” fall apart.
You need:
ICC profile support
CMYK preview (even if you don’t edit CMYK)
soft proofing
wide-gamut handling (Display P3, Adobe RGB)
16-bit + 32-bit float modes
Without these, studios won’t adopt it.
🗂️ 6. Layer Management That Scales
Small apps handle 10 layers. Pros handle 200.
You need:
tags
color-coded layers
search & filter
nested groups
collapse/expand
solo/isolate mode
reference layers
adjustable opacity/blend/search shortcuts
Artists spend 30% of their time managing layers — tools rarely help them.
🌐 7. Cross-Platform Availability
To compete broadly:
Windows
macOS
optional: iPad (huge artist market)
optional: Linux
Procreate succeeded because it dominated a platform (iPad).
But Photoshop/Krita/CSP win because they work everywhere.
💾 8. Rock-Solid Auto-Save + Versioning
Artists fear losing work more than anything.
Offer:
rolling autosaves
multiple snapshots/versions
version browser (like Figma/Notion/Pro tools)
This becomes a killer feature.
🤝 9. Collaborative or Cloud Sync Features
Not required, but would differentiate you hugely.
Ideas:
live cursor collaboration (like Figma)
cloud document sync
shared asset libraries
version comments
Nobody in painting apps is doing this well.
You could own this space.
📂 10. Simple, Predictable File Format
.psd works because it’s predictable and documented at least partially.
If you create your own:
open specification
stable
forward/backward compatible
ideally ZIP-based + folder structure (like .kra or .ora)
This builds trust and longevity.
🧠 11. AI Features as Tools, Not Gimmicks
AI helps adoption only when it’s integrated into real workflows.
Useful examples:
AI fill (texture-aware, not just “magic fill”)
edge-aware upscaling
color harmonization suggestions
palette extraction from references
brush gesture recognition
“clean lineart” AI passes
pose extraction or reference modeling
Avoid “AI painting for you” — pros hate that.
🧼 12. Aesthetic, Minimal UI — But with Professional Depth
Minimalism attracts beginners, but pros need depth.
Solution:
minimal UI by default
advanced mode or “expanded panels”
customizable workspace
floating or docked panels
shortcut-heavy workflow
Think:
Procreate’s simplicity + Photoshop’s depth.
This combination would be a major breakthrough.
🪜 13. Migration Tools
To help artists switch, offer:
“Import Photoshop shortcuts”
“Import CSP brushes”
“Convert PSD brush → your format”
“Convert ABR → your brushes”
Clone of common Photoshop tools (Lasso, Transform, Mask workflow)
Smooth transitions = adoption.
🎁 14. A Strong Identity / Niche
You don’t have to beat Photoshop at everything.
But you must beat Photoshop at something.
Options:
Cleanest brush engine
Perfect performance
Aesthetic UI
Best tablet experience
Best lineart tool
Best color workflow
Best collaboration
Best asset marketplace
No one remembers “another Photoshop alternative.”
People remember:
"the app that feels amazing to draw in"
or
"the app that’s lightning fast"
or
"the app that lets my team work together."
