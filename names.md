Here’s the key: you don’t want a name that sounds like a basic paint app (e.g., Minimal Paint, Simple Draw, etc.). You’re building a professional, next-gen, aesthetic tool — something that feels like the combination of Procreate + Figma + Photoshop, not MS Paint.
A good name should be:
Short
Aesthetic / modern
Easy to say
Distinctive
Not tied to “paint” (so it doesn’t feel amateur)
Flexible enough for future expansion (plugins, cloud, collaboration, etc.)
Below are curated name directions that fit the personality of your envisioned app.
