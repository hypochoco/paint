🎯 Top 7 Killer Features
🧪 1. Zero-Lag, Next-Gen Brush Engine (Your Core Differentiator)
If your brush engine instantly feels:
smoother than Procreate
more responsive than Photoshop
more configurable than Krita
cleaner and more modern than CSP
…you win hearts immediately.
Why this is killer:
Artists judge apps in 5 seconds based on brush feel.
🧩 2. Perfect PSD Import/Export (Better Than Everyone Else)
If you nail:
layer groups
blending modes
masks
editable text
smart-object-like containers
…then pros can instantly adopt your app into their workflow without switching fully.
This reduces friction to almost zero.
🧼 3. Modern UI That’s Minimal, Beautiful, and Adaptive
Think:
“Procreate meets Figma meets Photoshop.”
Core ideas:
minimal by default
deep tools when expanded
instant search (Spotlight-style) for commands
customizable panels
aesthetic, distraction-free canvas
A beautiful UI is a surprisingly powerful differentiator.
🧠 4. AI-as-Assistant (Not AI-as-Painter)
Artists hate AI that paints for them.
They love AI that reduces friction:
remove stray lines
smooth lineart
generate perspective grids
color-match reference palette
auto-extract pose reference from photo
auto-organize layers
intelligent fill for textures
content-aware transform
smart upscaling
This is a “feel like superpowers” category.
🧱 5. Snapshots / Timeline Versioning (Like Figma for Painting)
Photoshop, CSP, Krita — none do this well.
Imagine:
browseable versions
autosave with rollback
compare versions side by side
name versions
restore color palette or brush state from a version
Artists would LOVE this.
🏗️ 6. Plugin & Brush Marketplace (Built-In Store)
This is the single biggest money-maker & ecosystem builder.
Think:
brushes
textures
timelapse filters
perspective tools
color LUTs
AI utilities
UI themes
A thriving marketplace = network effect.
🌍 7. Realtime Collaboration Mode (Optional Killer Feature)
No painting app does this well.
Not Photoshop, not Procreate, not CSP.
If you offer:
two users on same canvas in real time
cursors with names
role-based editing
comment layers
…you would be the first to do it properly.
Studios and schools would adopt instantly.
🔥 Bonus Killer Features (High Impact)
🗂 Better Layer Management Than Photoshop
tagging
filtering (by color, type, name)
solo/isolate
“pin layers”
isolate color channels visually
This is deeply wanted.
🎨 Universal Brush Converter
Import:
.abr (Photoshop)
.sut/.suo (CSP)
.brushset (Procreate)
.myb (Medibang)
.gbr/.kpp (Krita)
No one does this perfectly. You could.
📐 Smart Reference Panel
in-app Pinterest-like board
color picker history with grouping
palette generator
notes, sketches, thumbnails
Artists currently use 3–5 external apps for references.
🧰 Tool Dial / Command Palette
Like:
Blender’s quick menu
Procreate’s radial tool menu
Figma’s command palette
This reduces UI clutter and accelerates workflow dramatically.
